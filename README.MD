# Interactive Statistics Notebooks

## TEMPLATE

Colab [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DOAeLRqRIHG6DG1N1s52iBgDc-jmPnh1) to the basic template with sections to fill and a tiny code sample

## What?

As a part of an Advanced Statistics Course at Innopolis University students suggested 
to implement Jupyter Notebook with interactive visual representation of several {which exactly?}
distributions, statistics, statistical tests distributions and so on {what else?}

## Why?

To provide a set of tools to help building intuition and visual recognition of most popular of mentioned topics

## How?

The course consists of several {these} topics. Every topic is presented as a Jupyter Notebook. Every notebook has the 
following template {link to a template}:
	
1. Introduction

	1.1 What is the distribution
	
	1.2 Where it can be used/met
	
	1.3 Known caveats/corener stones, etc.
	
2. Data loading/synthesis/generation

	2.1 Synthetical data sampling
	
	2.2 Real world data if exists
	
	2.3 Data exploration (interactive charts)
    
3. Applications

	3.1 A sample task statement
	
	3.2 Data collection
	
	3.3 Hypothesis statement
	
	3.4 Statistical tests
	
	3.5 Visualization
	
	3.6 Conclusion

4. Conclusion

	4.1 Where is this statistic/test/distribution is used
	
	4.2 What are the crititcal caveats/corner stones/limits of application
	
	4.3 What are the similar/opposite examples of statistics/tests/distribuitons if exist
